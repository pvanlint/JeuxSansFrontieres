# JeuxSansFrontieres
Experimental area to play with interesting tech, e.g. Docker and Node

*Dressing up in costumes, playing silly games*  
*Hiding out in tree-tops shouting out rude names*

Demos:
 * Go to Docker/Stream.server and run ./dockstart.sh <port>
 * Go to Docker/Stream.server and follow instructions in readme.txt to try out docker networking demo
 * Go to Docker/RestExample and run ./dockstart.sh to launch mongodb and load it with some data. This is the first step towards a rest API in docker demo, reading data from that mongo instance.
